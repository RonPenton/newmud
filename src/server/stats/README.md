Stats are decimal values that determine various characteristics of a player or an object throughout the game. These play into the rules of the engine. 

The stats of an object or actor are affected in various ways. For example, as a character in the game your stats will be affected by: 

1. Your "template" stats, which are inherited from your "class" or "race". 
2. Your "base" stats, which are the raw values attached to your character itself. 
3. Your "equipment" stats, which are the values attached to the items you are wearing.
4. Your "inventory" stats, which are additional values attached to items that you are carrying (mostly curses and debuffs).
5. The "room" stats, which are the values attached to the room you are in. 
6. The "area" stats, which are the values attached to the world you are in.
7. The "region" stats, which are the values attached to the entire game world.
8. The "world" stats, which are the values attached to the server itself.
9. Your "effects" stats, which are temporary values attached to your character.

The vast majority of effects are attached directly to objects using a "stats" structure.
